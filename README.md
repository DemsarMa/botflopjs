# In development
This is a direct fork-like repository (original fork: https://github.com/DemsarMa/botflop)
The goal is to convert the whole bot to JavaScript from Python (discord.js)
As is the need for Timings only, the code will consist only Timings (it's a subject to change)


The original Timings concept from Botflop:
## Analyze timings reports
Paste a timings report to review an in-depth description of potential optimizations. You can try it out yourself on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zsz3PzT)

# Forks
Feel free to fork. We request that you please give credit in some way (can be as simple as keeping binflop as the text upload destination), but you can do whatever you'd like with your forks.
